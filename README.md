# RabbitMQ Peer Discovery Commons

This library is similar in purpose to [rabbit-common](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common) but focusses exclusively
on peer discovery backends (new in 3.7.0, previously available as [a plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-autocluster)).

It is not supposed to be enabled, disabled or used directly by the users, only as a
dependency of other plugins.


## Project Maturity

This library is very immature and under heavy development. Steer clear from it for now.
